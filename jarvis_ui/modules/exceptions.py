    Notes:
        - This happens specifically for Linux based operating systems.
        - There are usually multiple sound APIs to choose from but not all of them might be configured correctly.
        - PyAudio goes through "ALSA", "PulseAudio" and "Jack" looking for audio hardware and that triggers warnings.
        - None of the options below seemed to work in all given conditions, so the approach taken was to hide them.

    Options:
        - Comment off the ALSA devices where the error is triggered.
        - Set energy threshold to the output from ``python -m speech_recognition``
        - Setting dynamic energy threshold to ``True``
